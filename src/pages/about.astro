            About R &amp; R Pressure Washing
        </h1>

        <p class="text-lg opacity-95">
            <strong class="text-primary">R &amp; R Pressure Washing</strong> started in Brampton, Ontario as a neighbourhood service and has expanded into a full
            professional operation serving clients across Canada. We combine hands-on experience with modern equipment and environmentally responsible cleaning methods.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 scroll-fade">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-base opacity-90 leading-relaxed scroll-fade">
            What began as local driveway and siding cleanups grew into a trusted team of technicians. We invested in professional training and upgraded to
            commercial-grade equipment, enabling us to take on larger residential and commercial projects with consistent, high-quality results.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 scroll-fade">Professional Tools &amp; Techniques</h2>
        <p class="text-base opacity-90 leading-relaxed scroll-fade">
            We use trailer-mounted hot-water systems, soft-wash setups for sensitive surfaces, surface cleaners for pavements, and high-capacity pumps for
            larger jobs. Our solutions include eco-friendly detergents and targeted application methods so surfaces are cleaned effectively without damage.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 scroll-fade">Insurance &amp; Safety</h2>
        <p class="text-base opacity-90 leading-relaxed scroll-fade">
            Our crews are trained in safe operation and we maintain appropriate insurance for peace of mind on every job. We follow safety best practices and
            communicate potential risks and recommended solutions before starting work.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 scroll-fade">Pricing &amp; Coverage</h2>
        <p class="text-base opacity-90 leading-relaxed scroll-fade">
            We provide transparent, no-surprise quotes and offer one-time services, seasonal cleanups, or ongoing maintenance plans. Although based in Brampton,
            we accept jobs across provinces and coordinate travel and logistics for efficient, cost-aware service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 scroll-fade">Our Commitment</h2>
        <p class="text-base opacity-90 leading-relaxed scroll-fade">
            Quality, safety, and customer satisfaction guide every job. We stand behind our work and aim for clear communication, punctual arrival, and lasting
            results.
